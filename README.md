## Little about myself üßôüèª
Hi, I'm fredrare, but you may know me as Antitesista as well. I have a strong background in algorithms, programming, networking and information security.

I'm a deeply curious person who loves challenges that go beyond what I think I know. I really enjoy competitive programming, hacking into stuff (legally, of course) and experimenting with technologies. I like designing solutions as well, so I consider myself a fullstack systems architect. I can design a solution with a perfect balance of efficiency and practicality, because experience has taught me that, sometimes, pitch perfect is the opposite of pitch practical.

## A bit of what I know regarding IT üìö
This is the list of things I believe I know in a pretty deep level (not marked the ones I am currently perfecting but I can use quite good anyway):
- [x] C
- [x] Java
- [x] Python
- [x] Mirai botnet
- [x] Process automation
- [x] Linux administration
- [x] Javascript and Node.js
- [x] Web and wifi pentesting
- [x] Functional programming theory
- [x] Protocols in various OSI layers
- [x] Network traffic and flow analysis
- [x] React, tailwind and that sort of stuff
- [x] Data modelling and database implementation
- [x] Rest APIs, webhooks, reverse proxying and auth
- [x] Wifi auditing, configuration and 2FA in enterprise networks
- [x] Network administration (for both SDN and traditional networks)
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Regex
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Microservices
- [ ] BSD administration
- [ ] Numpy, pandas, etc.
- [ ] Database administration
- [ ] Wordpress (I know, I know)
- [ ] Typescript (I like js more tbh)
- [ ] Neural networks, data mining in general
- [ ] Kotlin and Swift (I don't really like mobile programming tho')

## A bit of what I am still learning regarding IT üìì
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Assembly
- [ ] Privilege escalation
- [ ] Formal languages theory
- [ ] EM waves patterns, properties and planification

## A bit of what I want to learn regarding IT ‚úîÔ∏é
- [ ] Lisp
- [ ] Cobol
- [ ] Lockpicking
- [ ] How Elliot managed to do all of that
- [ ] Integrated circuits and hardware hacking

## A bit of what I am still learning in general „ä´
- [ ] Linear Algebra
- [ ] Differential equations
- [ ] More differential equations
- [ ] Japanese (currently studing for N3)

## Something more üòâ
As you may have seen, I kinda know pretty diverse stuff, but my main focus is security. That said, I am able to do almost anything I need to do because I do know core technologies in a lot of fields and I am able to learn any new framework or language in a matter of a few days or hours. And one last bit of info is that I am pretty damn smart, so that's about it.

Oh, and I use Arch, btw
